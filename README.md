# Portfolio
This is my updates to portfolio of my favorite projects from this year. 
The first project that I decided to make changes to was the first one that I did on this. It was my Bots creation where I created a twitter bot to post questions twice a day and coded how to do that. I enjoyed this project because it was my first and when going back through the projects that i created throughout the year it was crazy to look at this one and see how far I'd come. When I first made this project I always believed that it would be cool if my bot would be able to have a conversation instead of just ask an open ended and random question. So I decided I would take the originial prompt a step further and include an answer to the question as well as a goodbye to end the question. 

As you can see below my new line of code almost double and includes better punctuation and answers to the questions that I was putting out there:
{
	"one": ["Got ", "Do you have ", "Do you need ", "I have ", "Do you want" ],
	"two" : ["milk ", "money ", "a pencil ", "the time ", "my keys ", "a coat " , "a minute " , "some food "],
	"three": ["my guy", "pal", "dude", "sis"],
	"punct":["? ", "??! " , "?!?! "],
	  "one1":["I "],
  	"two1":["do","do not","wish I did", "hope so"],
  	"punct1":[". ", "! ", ":) "],
  	"one2": ["Okay. Have a good day! "],
  	"two2": ["You too!"],
	"origin": ["#one##two##three##punct##one1##two1##punct1##one2##two2#"]
}

Below is the twitter page that my bot posts to. At the time of this posts my page had 52 posts on it and unfortunaly still 0 followers.

I enjoy this version of the bot better because it never really felt right that I only had questions and to improve this by adding a start and finish to a quick conversation made the bot feel more like a person and less like a bot to me. Something this bot made me think about was the complexity that other twitter bots must have. In the last few weeks I was able to see twitter bots post on famous pages and it always struck me after I made my originial bot. I could never figure out how they could make their bot only post to specific pages with specific responses but that is something I'd like to learn more about. 
Lastly for this new project I now has 5191778592000 different outputs that it can generate and that was incredible to me! Overall the new bot is much better then the old. 

The second project that I go into is the poetry project. The poetry project had me take a poem and use text from a book to substitute different sections of the poems. I did this by coding in singular nouns, plural nouns, and adjectives. In my first version I used a poem by Robert Frost and substituted a few of the words in an attempt to change it but have it still make sense. When going back and adjusting my poem I decided I would edit it so that at the end of every sentence there was a new word. This changes the poems meaning and tempo throughout its entirety. I want to do this to see what creative poems my program would be able to make and really enjoyed this aspect. I also made minor structural adjustments for the poem to make more sense. These changes included spelling of some poem and the spaces between the end of the words before the random input so that there is proper spacing between the words. 

Here is my new poetry code:

The thrid project I looked at adjusting was my novel project. This was probably one of my favorite projects of the year. It is similar to the poetry project execept on a much larger scale. For this project I took the original Peter Pan story and replaces all of the charecters in the story with charecters from the childrens TV show Peppa Pig. When I first completed this assignment I thought it was funny to read the Peter Pan book with the funny charecters from Peppa Pig but I wanted to make the story have more humor and be more relatable to myself. I decided to make the changes of changing words such as Water with Lava and made words like Home change to the University of Mary Washington. After reading the story after I changed the places and things also instead of just names I really felt as if I was making a story of my own. I really enjoyed making these changes and added double the amount of changes I originally had. 
After changing this code I recognized some errors from within my code and made spelling changes to a few lines of code. im unsure how it ran before these changes were made but I now have all of the aspects of my line of code where I like them and how they were supposed to be. 
Here is the link to the story and also my updated line of code:

For the final project that I wanted to improve I looked at my screensaver project. The originial project that I had wass supposed to have a ball moving a top of my background but could never figure out how to make the background sit behind the object I wanted to show. Through trial and error of trying to adjust my code I was never able to figure out how to place the ball on top of the background. When I was unable to complete that I decided to adjust the screensaver I had already created. I changed the color scheme of the screensave to scheme that included much darker and less opaque colors. I then adjusted the width of the lines through the screensaver and increased the frame rate in order to create amuch mover visually appealing screensaver. The screensaver project was my second favorite project of the year because I felt that it was one of the projects that I could completely control the outcome of. Unlike the poem and Novel projects, this project was completely up to me on how it looked and worked. this new screensaver is much more of the originial idea that I had in my head and with a better understanding of the functions needed to create the changes I was able to accomplish a screensaver I am very proud of!

Throughout this semester my knowledge and understanding of coding and coding language has grown incredibly. Just through working through these projects again and making adjustments showed me jsut how simple the first projects really were, and this is completely different from when I origininally attempted them. My first time through these it took my hours to understand even simple coding but now I have the capability to change and write codes like these with ease. I'm glad I went back through these just to see how much my ability to code has changed through the semester.
